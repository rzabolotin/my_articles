# Robert Matrin "The Clean Coder"

I have read the book by Robert Martin "The clean coder", and want to share my takeaways with.

The author is good known in our sphere, more often as "Unckle Bob". He also wrote the book "Clean code", "Clean arhitecture" and more. 
I used to start readint the "Clean code" book, but haven't finished it. But, it has big influence to me, I started to think about "clean" code, his simplicity. I complied with idea, that we spent 10 times more time on rereading our code, then on writing it, and therefore it makes sense to think about code clarity and readability for everyone who will read it in futere (even for ourselves).

But now, I want to write down my thoughts about "The clean coder" book. Let's start

## My takeaways

### Comunication
Communication is crusual skill for developer (even if you don't like it). 

- you need to understand buisiness, in which you work, and streeve to help it to succeed
- do not promise to do things (do not agree to deadlines), the success of which you are not sure
- it is better for everyone to know about problems in advance, and not later. 
- refuse if asked for the impossible. But you need to explain why this is impossible, try to make them understand you and find a common compromise.
- If you promised something, then take it responsibly and fulfill it. And if something doesn't work out, then let us know as soon as possible.
- You also need to talk with colleagues, help them, share new knowledge, train young professionals

### Responsibility
Responsibility is an important trait for a programmer. As your career grows, so does your responsibility. For the product, for your efforts, for the quality of the product.

### Coding trainings (katas)
I was surprised by the idea of training every day by solving basic problems. Simple katas for algorithms, for refactoring, for application architecture. 
You need to learn different programming languages and technologies.

### Pair programming, test driven development
The author praised programming techniques from Extreme Programming TDD and Pair Programming. It would be nice to get some practice on them someday. 
At work, I began to try to write according to the TDD, when it works, but vary little. Maybe in future I will try it more.

### Your behavior in critiacal sitiations
Working in a critical situation. What should be inherent in a professional when everything falls and falls. He must remain professional. Do what you have always done, be true to your practices.

### Clean code
It also recommends refactoring frequently, and don't spread dirt in the code, because it leads to slowdowns and loss of momentum in the future.
